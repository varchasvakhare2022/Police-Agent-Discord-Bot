## üéØ **The Mission**

Police Agent was born from a simple yet ambitious goal: **to create the ultimate moderation companion for my Detective-themed Discord server**. As the server grew and evolved around our beloved game bot, I realized we needed more than just basic moderation tools - we needed a **digital police force** that could maintain order, protect our community, and ensure everyone could enjoy their detective adventures without disruption.

## üïµÔ∏è **The Story Behind the Code**
